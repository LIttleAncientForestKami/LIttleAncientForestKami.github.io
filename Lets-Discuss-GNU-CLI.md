## Fun game with basic CLI and networking

Some time ago I wrote about [discussing swords and Java](https://lafkblogs.wordpress.com/tag/discuss-java/), true Wuxia style.

Today, thanks to [Chlebik](https://chlebik.wordpress.com/2015/02/25/hacking-as-game/), I learned about *Over the Wire*. 

And now I have an account over at [**WeChall**]() and will play that. I spend two hours today having fun with simple GNU/Linux commands.

I learned about `xxd -r hexdump`, Vim's awesome `g?` for ROT13, where `ls -Rl` loses against `find . -exec ls -l {} ;`, `file` being able to tell quite a lot about binary 
files (archives, elf binary), had a good recollection of SSH connections with deliberately altered `.bashrc` file (exit upon SSH login), 
played with `nc`, `nmap`, `openssl s_client` and refreshed number of others.

And that was the primer challenge series. :-) 

Excellent for discussing CLI, I shall use it. 

My thanks to masters behind [OverTheWire.org](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) and it's Bandit Game and [WeChall!](https://www.wechall.net/profile/LAFK_pl), a site who works as both challenge site and aggregator for other challenge sites. Neet idea!
